# Code & Supply Press Kit

## What is Code & Supply?

[Code & Supply Co.][co] is a Pittsburgh-based but worldwide community of software professionals, enthusiasts, students, and more.
C&S, founded in 2013 and incorporated in 2014, started as a Meetup group ([Pittsburgh Code & Supply][meetup]), [chat community][chat], and [job board][jobs]
before expanding into hosting large technology conferences such as [Abstractions][abst], [Heartifacts][hrtfcts], and [Uptime][uptime]
and operating a [coworking space][workspace] that contributes a majority of the funding for the meeting space for C&S events and many other Pittsburgh-area tech organizations.
C&S also conducts the biennial-ish [Compensation Survey for Tech Workers][survey], which captures a snapshot of tech workers' compensation, work life, job satisfaction, commute, tools, and more.

In 2016, a generous philanthropist software engineer funded the creation of the non-profit [Code & Supply Scholarship Fund][fund],
a separate legal entity that awards software conference travel scholarships and other educational experience funding with a focus
on promoting and enabling the Pittsburgh software community.

## What are C&S' lines of business?

* Conferences
* Meetups
* Online Communities (Slack, YouTube, Twitch, Instagram, Fediverse/Mastodon, Twitter)
* Job Board
* Tech Worker Compensation Survey and other knowledge-sharing initiatives
* Logo and coding, techie, and geek merchandise
* Co-working space, individual and group rental

[CSSF][fund] runs as an entirely separate organization.

## Logos

See our [assets][assets] repo for the full set but we tend to use these the most.

### Wordmark logo

Use the wordmark logo where there's inadequate context to link "Code & Supply" with our logo.

[![Code & Supply Wordmark logo](https://github.com/codeandsupply/assets/blob/master/logos/wordmark/logo.svg)](https://github.com/codeandsupply/assets/blob/master/logos/wordmark)

We have it in a variety of formats available by clicking on the wordmark logo above.

### Imprint logo

Use the imprint in contexts where "Code & Supply" will be written and visually associated with the logo.

See the [imprint logos](https://github.com/codeandsupply/assets/tree/master/logos/imprint) for variations. N.b. most of the most useful files are in the "bruteforce" directory.

## How to refer to Code & Supply

When referring to Code & Supply, please remember these:

* It's acceptable to refer to all Code & Supply efforts as "Code & Supply" but if you need to be specific about which part of Code & Supply or will be talking about both orgs in the same context, use something closer to our legal names:

    * Code & Supply Co. - Meetups, conferences, Workspace coworking, chat communities, etc.
    * Code & Supply Scholarship Fund - our sibling non-profit organization that funds conference travel and other educational experiences
    
  We commonly refer to these as "Co" and "Fund" when we have reason to disambiguate.
  
* Use "Code & Supply" on first reference for Co. Please use the ampersand.
* Use "Code & Supply Scholarship Fund" on first reference for Fund.
* It's acceptable to abbreviate on subsequent references. Use "C&S" for "Co" and "CSSF" for "Fund" references.
* It's acceptable to use "codeandsupply" only when referring to one of our communities or resources by its account or server name, e.g. `@codeandsupply` for most of our social media accounts.
  
Do not:

* Refer to Code & Supply as "CNS" or "CnS" or "CaS" or "CAS" or any other abbrevation of 'and'— just use the ampersand. It's a `&amp;` in HTML if you're writing raw HTML!
