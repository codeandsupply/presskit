# Code & Supply Press Kit

## Logos

See our [assets](https://github.com/codeandsupply) repo for the full set but we tend to use these the most.

### Wordmark logo

Use the wordmark logo where there's inadequate context to link "Code & Supply" with our logo.

[![Code & Supply Wordmark logo](https://github.com/codeandsupply/assets/blob/master/logos/wordmark/logo.svg)](https://github.com/codeandsupply/assets/blob/master/logos/wordmark)

We have it in a variety of formats available by clicking on the wordmark logo above.

### Imprint logo

Use the imprint in contexts where "Code & Supply" will be written and visually associated with the logo.

See the [imprint logos](https://github.com/codeandsupply/assets/tree/master/logos/imprint) for variations. N.b. most of the most useful files are in the "bruteforce" directory.

## Naming

When referring to Code & Supply, please remember these:

* It's acceptable to refer to all Code & Supply efforts as "Code & Supply" but if you need to be specific about which part of Code & Supply or will be talking about both orgs in the same context, use something closer to our legal names:

    * Code & Supply Co. - Meetups, conferences, Workspace coworking, chat communities, etc.
    * Code & Supply Scholarship Fund - our sibling non-profit organization that funds conference travel and other educational experiences
    
  We commonly refer to these as "Co" and "Fund" when we have reason to disambiguate.
  
* Use "Code & Supply" on first reference for Co. Please use the ampersand.
* Use "Code & Supply Scholarship Fund" on first reference for Fund.
* It's acceptable to abbreviate on subsequent references. Use "C&S" for "Co" and "CSSF" for "Fund" references.
* It's acceptable to use "codeandsupply" only when referring to one of our communities or resources by its account or server name, e.g. `@codeandsupply` for most of our social media accounts.
  
Do not:

* Refer to Code & Supply as "CNS" or "CnS" or "CaS" or "CAS" or any other abbrevation of 'and'â€” just use the ampersand. It's a `&amp;` in HTML if you're writing raw HTML!
