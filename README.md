# Code & Supply Press Kit

## What is Code & Supply?

[Code & Supply Co.][co] is a Pittsburgh-based but worldwide community of software professionals, enthusiasts, students, and more.
C&S, founded in 2013 and formalized in 2014, started as a Meetup group ([Pittsburgh Code & Supply][meetup]), [chat community][chat], and [job board][jobs]
before expanding into hosting large technology conferences such as [Abstractions][abst], [Heartifacts][hrtfcts], and [Uptime][uptime]
and operating a [coworking space][workspace] that also hosts meetings for C&S and many other Pittsburgh-area tech organizations.
C&S also conducts the biennial [Compensation Survey for Tech Workers][survey], which captures a snapshot of tech workers' compensation, work life, job satisfaction, commute, tools, and more.

In 2016, a generous philanthropist software engineer funded the creation of the non-profit [Code & Supply Scholarship Fund][fund],
a separate legal entity that awards software conference travel scholarships and other educational experience funding with a focus
on promoting and enabling the Pittsburgh software community.

## How to refer to Code & Supply

When referring to Code & Supply, please remember these:

* It's acceptable to refer to all Code & Supply efforts as "Code & Supply" but if you need to be specific about which part of Code & Supply or will be talking about both orgs in the same context, use something closer to our legal names:

    * Code & Supply Co. - Meetups, conferences, Workspace coworking, chat communities, etc.
    * Code & Supply Scholarship Fund - our sibling non-profit organization that funds conference travel and other educational experiences
    
  We commonly refer to these as "Co" and "Fund" when we have reason to disambiguate.
  
* Use "Code & Supply" on first reference for Co. Please use the ampersand.
* Use "Code & Supply Scholarship Fund" on first reference for Fund.
* It's acceptable to abbreviate on subsequent references. Use "C&S" for "Co" and "CSSF" for "Fund" references.
* It's acceptable to use "codeandsupply" only when referring to one of our communities or resources by its account or server name, e.g. `@codeandsupply` for most of our social media accounts.
  
Do not:

* Refer to Code & Supply as "CNS" or "CnS" or "CaS" or "CAS" or any other abbrevation of 'and'— just use the ampersand. It's a `&amp;` in HTML if you're writing raw HTML!

## What's the difference between Co and Fund?
